JS beginner Project:

1. A default image should be displayed when you load the page.
2. When you click the “left” button, one of five profil should display, all the way until each of the 
five profils display in sequence.
3. Repeat step 2 for the “right” button.
4. If the user continues to click the left or right button, the profils should reset once it passes the 
first profil in the array.
